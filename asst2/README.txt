Assignment 2


List of all files we've modified include:
- matrix4.h
- asst2.cpp
All other files submitted were exactly the same as the files given in the starter code. 

We've both done our work on Windows, and the compile instructions are standard. We haven't changed any of that. 
We believe we've met all problem set requirements, as per the specification. We've also compared to the solution binaries and believe that our code runs with the same result. 

In terms of code design, we've implemented the transFact and linFact functions in matrix4.h . We've used various counters to keep track of the active frames, objects, and view points in asst2.cpp. Finally, we've modified the a frame to rely on the active object's origin and the active viewpoint's axis.

In terms of running the program, as per the spec, you can use the 'm' key to change frames, the 'o' key to change the active object, and the 'v' key to change the view point. For the mouse button usage, we followed the spec exactly as well, left button for rotation, right button for translation and the middle button for translation in the z direction.
